    <div class="desc-div">
    <p class="description">	A guitar is a 6 string instrument with a fretted fingerboard that can be played by either plucking or strumming the strings. There are many different kinds of guitars, but the two most popular types are acoustic guitars that are typically much cheaper and can incorporate percussion and strumming and electric guitars that use amplifiers to strengthen and manipulate the sound.</p>
